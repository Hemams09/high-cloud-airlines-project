# high-cloud-airlines-project
Project Overview
This project is a data visualization dashboard created in Tableau for High Cloud Airlines, aimed at helping stakeholders monitor key metrics related to flight performance, delays, and operational efficiency. It simulates a real-world business scenario and demonstrates the ability to convert raw aviation data into actionable insights.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To analyze airline performance data and present it in an interactive, professional-style dashboard using Tableau. The goal is to:

Track key performance indicators (KPIs)

Identify top-performing routes and carriers

Analyze delay patterns

Support decision-making with clear visual insights

ðŸ“Š Key Features
Interactive Filters for carrier, date range, origin, and destination

KPIs such as Total Flights, On-Time %, Delays %, and Cancelled Flights

Bar Charts and Maps to visualize route and distance-based trends

Delay Analysis segmented by cause (weather, late aircraft, etc.)

User-Friendly Layout with a clean and enterprise-style design

ðŸ§° Tools Used
Tableau Desktop â€“ for dashboard creation

Excel/CSV â€“ as the data source

Data Cleaning â€“ done in Excel and Tableau prep (if applicable)

ðŸ“‚ Dataset Details
Source: Simulated airline operations data

Fields Included:

Flight Date, Origin, Destination

Distance, Carrier, Flight Status

Delay Reasons: Weather, NAS, Security, Late Aircraft, etc.

ðŸš€ Outcome
The dashboard provides quick insights into operational efficiency and highlights problem areas that may require further investigation. It mimics what a business intelligence tool would offer to a real airline's operations or analytics team.

ðŸ§  Learning Highlights
Building enterprise-style dashboards

Applying design best practices for usability

Using filters, parameters, and calculated fields in Tableau

Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

ðŸ“Ž How to Use
Open the Tableau workbook (HighCloudAirlines.twb or .twbx)

Use filters on the dashboard to explore the data

Hover over charts for tooltips and additional insights
